"Demons run when a good man goes to war."
- Some quote


-------
They came.

No one believed it, but they came.

And they took, they killed. They raped, and they laughed.

Men, women, and the children.

A small group of people have formed an alliance to fight.

But fuck them, we never got along with people anyways.

Choices. We're defined by the choices we make.

Did you make good choices today?

Either we're alone in space, or we're not. Either are terrifying.
